  <p class="push-1-2">I always liked to watch cartoons. However, I couldn’t watch the more popular series (i.e. <i>SpongeBob SquarePants</i>, <i>Dexter’s Laboratory</i>, <i>Teen Titans</i>, <i>Hey Arnold!</i>, <i>Ed, Edd n Eddy</i>, <i>Phineas and Ferb</i>, <i>The Fairy OddParents</i>, etc). I was limited to <i>Arthur</i>, <i>Blue's Clues</i>, <i>Clifford the Big Red Dog</i>, <i>The Magic School Bus</i>, etc. Whenever my parents are going to their friends’ house, I would follow them and watch TV at their friends’ house. When I got older, I was into Japanese anime series. I watched more than 1000 episodes and 50 anime series up until now. Animation was part of my childhood and teenager. It entertained my life.</p>
  <p class="push-1-2">Once I got in Graphic Design, I was looking forward to start and learn motion graphics in second year. Creating videos can convey a message, learn new knowledge or entertain the viewers. It could change their mood from negative to positive if they had a bad day. This is why I want to be a motion designer.</p>
