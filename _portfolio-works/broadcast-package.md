  I created a broadcast-package for a fictional client. The client wants to have a YouTube channel and he wants to have highlights of his favourite Twitch streamers. It shows the intro, lower-third and transition.

  I have to gather all the Twitch clips and make the intro, lower-third, and transition consistent across all of them.
