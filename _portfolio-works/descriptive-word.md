name: "Descriptive Word"
description: |
  I had to choose a word and I had to add some illustrations and sounds to describe that word. The reason why I chose the word snoring is because my friends and I were playing Drawful 2. Someone came up with the title snoring and another  person needs to draw that title for other people to guess the title that he got. The person who draw the picture targeted the other friend because he snores loudly. It was funny and mean at the same time.
