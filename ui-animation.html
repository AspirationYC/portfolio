    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Description</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">Transforming my intro to UI animation project into an actual app advertisement.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Goal(s)</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">My goal is to create an app advertisement for the app. The app allows the users to vote online and read candidates’ platform. It is also trying to grab attention for the people who doesn’t vote because they are either too busy or not interested in politics.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Challenge(s)</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">The challenge is to make it innovative so that it isn’t only an app advertisement. At the same time, it needs to grab attention from the viewers.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Solution(s)</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">To grab attention from the viewers, I thought of using empathy to the target audience. Hopefully, they will feel more related to keep watching the video. Furthermore, I thought of an idea that could register faster to the app. On the voter information card, it could have a QR code and the user has to scan the QR code and it will register his personal information automatically.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Steps to complete the project</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I was asked to find a target and indicator from the Sustainable Development Goals in UI/UX design class. My classmate and I picked the goal number 16, in which it is about peace, justice, and strong institutions. The target was to develop effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels. There is a lot of biased information about the candidates on Internet so some of the new voters don’t really know which information are accurate. Hence, we want to create an app product that gives accurate information about the candidates. Furthermore, the app will have features for voting online anonymously and see the results. During our researches, we found out that the people who doesn’t vote are young adults because they are too busy with work, university, or college. Also, some people aren’t just interested in politics to vote. So, we are going to try to targeting the one who are too busy because we believe that it is important to vote. After the research, my classmate and I have to split up because we need to create our own prototype.</p>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">A semester later, in motion graphics class, I learned a little bit on how to create UI animation and I had to pick one of our old projects. I picked the voting app that I did in UI/UX design class. It was only an intro so the criteria were to animate one flow of action.</p>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">On my 5th semester, we had to pick one of the older projects to improve it and add something that is innovative. Again, I picked the voting app because it was only an intro to UI animation. I had trouble with the easing so I want to fix that issue. Also, I want to create an app advertisement and add all the main features of the app. I start off with a storyboard for the video and build up some assets. After, I complete all the assets, I can finally start working in After Effects.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Problem(s) encountered</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I had problem with easing on the question mark. It moves too quickly and unnaturally. Also, the second image looks more transparent than the other images so I had to fix that.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">How I solve it?</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I used the graph editor to change the easing of the question mark to make it more natural. I just made the second image have different keyframes than the first and last one. In addition, I made the keyframes closer so it doesn’t show the transparency.</p>
