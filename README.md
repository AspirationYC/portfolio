I always liked to watch cartoons. However, I couldn’t watch the more popular series (i.e. *SpongeBob SquarePants*, *Dexter’s Laboratory*, *Teen Titans*, *Hey Arnold!*, *Ed, Edd n Eddy*, *Phineas and Ferb*, *The Fairy OldParents*, etc). I was stuck with *Arthur*, *Blue's Clues*, *Clifford the Big Red Dog*, *The Magic School Bus*, etc. Whenever my parents are going to their friends’ house, I would follow them and watch TV at their friends’ house. When I got older, I was into Japanese anime series. I watched more than 1000 episodes and 50 anime series up until now. Animation was part of my childhood and teenager. It entertained my life.

Once I got in Graphic Design, I was looking forward to start and learn motion graphics in second year. Creating videos can convey a message, learn new knowledge or entertain the viewers. It could change their mood from negative to positive if they had a bad day. This is why I want to be a motion designer.
