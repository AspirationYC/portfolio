    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">Using graphic illustrations and sounds to describe the word.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">The reason why I chose the word snoring is because my friends and I were playing Drawful 2. Someone came up with the title snoring and another person needs to draw that title for other people to guess the title that he got. The person who draw the picture targeted the other friend because he snores loudly. It was funny and mean at the same time.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Problem(s) encountered</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">The professor gave me feedbacks for my video. I originally used the stroke line to create the leg and the feet. It wasn’t attached as well so it looked unnatural. So I have to fix that.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">How I solve it?</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2"></p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2 text-center">Looping GIF</h2>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Description</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">Come up with a concept that can be looped forever.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Inspiration</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">As you may know if you read my about section, I watched a lot of anime series so I got inspired from one of the series called Naruto.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Problem(s) encountered</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">My concept was probably hard to understand for some people because there are too many hard cuts from scene to scene and it is a little bit too fast.</p>
    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">How I solve it?</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I need to re-do my illustrations so the video should just zoom in instead of hard cutting between scenes.</p>
