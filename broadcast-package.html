    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Description</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I was asked to create a broadcast package for my own fictional YouTube channel. The channel will show highlights of my favourite streamers. It shows the intro, a lower-third and transition.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Challenge(s)</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I will need to create a logo for the YouTube channel and gather some Twitch clips to include in the video. In addition, I need to think of a concept for the intro, lower-third and transition. It needs to look consistent across the three elements.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Solution(s)</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">For the logo, I thought using the bubble chat from the Twitch logo because it is related to Twitch and add my ligature inside the bubble chat. Below the logo, it will have a text labelled Highlights. It will have a yellow background behind the text because it will act as a highlighter. For the introduction, I thought of showing a quick preview of the streamers will be included in the video. In addition, it will preview a clip and freeze the screen after a few second and it will show their full name and online username. The screen will be grey out except the streamer’s whole body. The lower-third will show the Twitch streamer username and their social media. The transition will act as a highlighter. So, it will be a rectangular bar that moves from the left side to right side or vise-versa.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Steps to complete the project</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <p class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">To start off, I created two style frames and a storyboard for the video. The style frames are static images of what it would look like for the final version. The storyboard will tell what will happen inside the video. I created my wireframes on Adobe Illustrator.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">After that, I went to find Twitch clips. I actually never downloaded Twitch clips before so I had to search online on how to download Twitch clips. If you are curious, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/8inngo/guide_how_to_download_clips_from_twitchtv/">here</a> is the link for the guide.</p>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">After I gather the clips, I imported all my clips into After Effects and start building the video.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">Problem(s) encountered</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">The main problem that I encountered is the timing from switching clip to next clip in the introduction. Sometimes, it won’t just start from the beginning of the clip.</p>

    <h2 class="unit s-1 m-1 l-1 island-1-4 push-1-2">How I solve it?</h2>
    <p class="unit s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 island-1-4 push-1-2">I just took my time and work more slowly and precisely because some compositions were overlapping with each other so I had to move the compositions and fix my keyframes.</p>
